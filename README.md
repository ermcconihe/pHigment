# pHigment: Designing Biodegradable Single-Use Cosmetics for On-body Chemical Sensing

This repository contains the study code for the paper "pHigment: Designing Biodegradable Single-Use Cosmetics for On-body Chemical Sensing."

## Goal
Consider replacing existing single-use makeup products with biodegradable, colorimetric biosensing materials. Red Cabbage powder is a colorimetric dye that reacts to pH giving insights into dental, vaginal, and skin health.

## Overview
pHigment explores the integration of biosensing and biodegradable materials within single-use cosmetics, including temporary tattoos, eyeliner stickers, and press-on nails. These formats often come into contact with body fluids such as sweat, tears, or saliva, and allow for diverse placement on the body, customizable shapes, and a range of colors—features that support the visual transitions of colorimetric biosensors. Unlike conventional cosmetics that absorb into the skin or wear off, these products retain their material structure and are typically discarded after brief use, contributing to landfill waste due to their synthetic components. By focusing on single-use cosmetics, this project addresses both the functional potential of on-body sensing and the environmental impact of cosmetic disposability.


We frame this project around the dual objective of designing on-body colorimetric biosensors that promote health and environmental awareness, while using biodegradable materials suited for single-use lifecycles. We present four main contributions:

(1) The articulation of this duality in biocosmetic interface design. We create a set of working prototypes—eyeliner, temporary tattoos, and press-on nails—that demonstrate how ephemeral cosmetic products can serve as both responsive sensors and compostable, body-worn devices;

(2) A DIY, skin-safe, biodegradable fabrication process based on alginate formulations with embedded anthocyanin;

(3) A detection system combining a custom case for light control and a computer vision app that converts RGB color to pH value;

(4) A compostability test of the material under natural conditions.

## Abstract
This project explores the dual design challenge of creating on-body
interfaces that are both environmentally sustainable and capable of
on-body chemical sensing. We present a set of single-use cosmetic
prototypes—eyeliner, temporary tattoos, and press-on nails—that
respond to chemical changes in body and external fluids while
being fully compostable after use. Each prototype is fabricated using
alginate as a biodegradable substrate and anthocyanin, derived from
red cabbage powder, as a colorimetric indicator. We describe the
fabrication process and introduce a system that includes a custom-
designed case and a computer vision–based mobile application that
interprets color changes and outputs corresponding pH values. We
report technical evaluations of the materials, system functionality,
and compostability. This work contributes to biocosmetic interface
design by demonstrating how ephemeral body-worn form factors
can simultaneously serve as both responsive chemical sensors and
components of a circular materials strategy.



## Features

- **Eyeliner, Temporary Tattoos, and Press-On Nails**: Designed to indicate pH levels through color changes.
- **Mobile App**: Utilizes a CNN model for pH level detection.
- **Data Collection**: Includes variations in lighting, camera conditions, and user responses.
- **Improved Detection**: Shows enhanced pH variation detection over traditional methods.


## Fabrication

**Ingredients: (Measure in Mixing Order)**
- 100 g Water 
- 0.5 g Red Cabbage Powder 
- 0.1 g Titanium Dioxide 
- 5 g Glycerine 
- 2.5 gSunflower Oil 
- 3 g Sodium Alginate 

**Instructions:**
1. Use an immersion blender
2. Add sodium alginate slowly (this prevents clumping)
3. Use a vaccumm chamber to remove trapped airbubbles
4. Pour on Acrylic Sheet
5. Use acrylic strip or scraper to spread evenly
6. Spray Calcium Chloride solution to cure
7. Leave to dry for 6 days
8. Following Cricut Tattoo Paper instructions, stick the colorimetric sheet on instead
9. Cut using Silouhette Cameo
10. Stick sticker on nails, eyes, or anywhere on your arms or legs to read the pH of your environment

## Software Implementation

1. **Mobile Application**: Located in the `app` folder.
